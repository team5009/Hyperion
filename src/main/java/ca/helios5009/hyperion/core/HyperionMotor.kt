/**
 * HyperionMotor is a class that allows for the creation of motors for the robot to use.
 *
 * What makes this class different is it caches the power of the motor. This is to prevent
 * setting the power of the motor to the same value.
 * Every time the power is changed, the call from the control hub to the motor takes time.
 * Caching makes it so the motor doesn't have to be set to the same power.
 *
 * @param motor The DcMotorEx that the HyperionMotor is controlling.
